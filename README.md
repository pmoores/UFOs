# Module 11 Challenge - UFO Sightings


## Project Overview
To allow users of Dana's UFO sightings website to filter by multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, table filters were added for the city, state, country, and shape.


## Results
- The new webpage can now be filtered by the date of the sighting, as well as by the city, state, country and shape of sighted object: [Example Filtered by Shape](https://github.com/pmoores/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/Single_Filter.png).

- The webpage can also be filtered by multiple criteria: [Example Filtered by City and Shape](https://github.com/pmoores/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/Multiple_Filter.png).


## Summary
- One drawback of the new design is that search terms must be entered exactly for the filters to work. For example, entering "california" in the state search box will not return the correct results ("ca" must be used).

- Two recommendations for further development: (1) Change search filters to allow for other terms for the same thing (e.g. entering "california" or "ca" in the State search box would show results for California. (2) Add an additional filter to search through the Comments data.
